        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
        if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
        make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best – and most grueling – time
        of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
        working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
        Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
        refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out
        in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard
        is above the rest. You’ll get the personal attention you need from an incredible
        community of smart and amazing people. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’d never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from professionals who could help me learn step by step. The entire
        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. The agile team project, in particular,
        was outstanding and helped me land a job as a full-stack developer. ”
